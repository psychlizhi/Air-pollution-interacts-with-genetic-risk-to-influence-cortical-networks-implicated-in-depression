This repository provides the main scirpts and data for the paper 'Air pollution interacts with genetic risk to influence cortical networks implicated in depressionâ€™. Li et al, PNAS 2021.

spm_dcm_spm.m was used to build the seven dynamic causal models for each pair of ROIs for each subject.

func_dcm_BMA.m was used to derive the effective connectivity across 23 pairs of ROIs during the numerical working memory task.

Folder DCM_results contains effective connectivity across the ROIs for each subject, during working memory encoding (M), maintenance (ME) and mainipulation (MCE), under social stress (C), or without the stress (NC) condition.

Pollution.xls contains the PM2.5 exposure over 6 months for each subject.

Demographic, behavioral and genetic data were obtained from Zhang et al, Transl Psychiatry 2021 (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-021-01650-x).

The cortical ROIs were obtained from the human connectome project: https://www.humanconnectome.org/ (Glasser et al, 2016: https://www.nature.com/articles/nature18933).

The genes associated with depression were obtained from the table 2 in the GWAS study for depression by Wray et al (2018: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0090-3).

Gene expression data from each brain ROI were obtained from the Allen Human Brain Atlas: https://human.brain-map.org/static/download.
