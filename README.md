This repository provides the main scirpts and data from the paper 'Air pollution interacts with genetic risk to influence cortical networks implicated in depression'. 

spm_dcm_spm.m was used to build the seven dynamic causal models for each subject individually, while func_dcm_BMA.m was used to derive the effective connectivity across 23 brain regions during performing a numerical working memory task.

Folder DCM_results contains individual effective connectivity of each subject during performing encoding (e), maintenaning (me) and mainipulation (mce) with (c) or without stress (nc) condition.

Exposure to PM2.5, polygenic risk for depression, reasoning and problem solving and trait anxiety-depression were contained in the file 'to be added'.
